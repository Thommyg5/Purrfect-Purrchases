# Purrfect Purrchases

Purrfect Purrchases is a site for cat lovers who are trying to find their feline friends. Users can register to the page, log in, and start filtering for their purrfect friend. Users can go on the site, and view from a list of available cats looking for a home. Once they find that purrfect friend, they can select their furry companion, complete their adoption form, check out, and make their home complete. Regular users can come back to the site at any time, and see information about the cats theyâ€™ve adopted, including medical records, physical descriptions, and photos.
